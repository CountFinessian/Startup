Evil Merge Conflict
Test little thingIntially I stuggled with some editing issues trying to freehand everything and I somhow broke my repository. Istead of figuring out how to fix it, I made a new one.
I'm trying to figure out page break



I think I finally figure out page break

Elevator Pitch: Imagine a world of trading without the hassle of using your own money. Battle against your friends in a 1 on 1 simulation to see who can generate the most alpha. RAFT will utilize the Yahoo Finance API and and Websockets to communicate and compare performance metrics peer to peer. The game will be barebones in design, featuring a buy and sell button and trader's gut instinct. Do you think you have what it takes to come out on top?

That's it, I have officially created a website. Initially, I couldn't figured out how to get into my website. It said [blank] sent an invalid response. After, consulting discord, I found someone else experiencing the same "Issue was I was typing in https://, it wasn't working, but when I do http:// it does work."

I am driving my own website name! It took a while for my website request to stop pending. The proccess of tying my website name to my ip address was easy. 
I have updated my website to https instead of http so now it is secured. The proccess is neat becuase of how simple it is to make a secured website. I forgot to hit escape when after I was in editing mode in git bash and left and made a merge conflict unintentionally. I restarted the cornel and deleted the change and tried again.
2/6/2023: Now I am updating the HTML structure and my favorite part are the hpyerlinks becuase it seems like majic. It is cool being able to edit a website and seeing it change after you save. Like I did something. The format type of html is confusing. I am figuring things out by trial and error by deleting it and seeing what it does. I like all the boxes and borders but don't really get the intention or integration. I've been busy breaking your code in html and experimenting with boxes. I have so say it's hard to break the code and do stuff to it than I anticipated. It is completely unlike Python or C++ and more like an instruction manual instead of step by step directions.
2/7: I've decided to timestamp the things I do. That way It'll be better indexed. Today I changed my website through the github repo proffessor Jensen made for me. I was struggling until I realized I had to gitclone the url into my projectfile to access eployWebsite.sh, but after that, it was suprisingly smooth sailing.
2/8: It's been an enthralling expreience pushing the website up and having a subset of it created in the simon directory. I am enjoying the proccess of git cloning my directory and then going in and git pull and doing $ ./deployFiles.sh -k ~/CS260/1220.pem -h startup260.click -s simon to update my website online.
2/6 (Late?) I think the coolest part of the website image is you're tying a piece that you don't really own and just linking it to display on your website. This is opposed to uploading a photo to GitHub where it is stored. It's on the web, you're just conveniently retrieving it. 
(2/12) This assignment impressed me with the durability of Code pen. This resource rendered my website fast, allowing for Realtime iteration. I found out that you use selectors to modify different parts of the html. The two codes, html and css, are durable and mesh well.  
(2/15) I learned how to use an iteractive button to complete commands. For example, mine changed the image from a blue whale to a basking shark. I learned to use Media queries to rotate the whale facing down so she was in view while in portrait mode. This assignnment pushed me to figure out how devolopers make website mobile compatible.
