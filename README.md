Evil Merge Conflict
Test little thingIntially I stuggled with some editing issues trying to freehand everything and I somhow broke my repository. Istead of figuring out how to fix it, I made a new one.
I'm trying to figure out page break



I think I finally figure out page break

Elevator Pitch: Imagine a world of trading without the hassle of using your own money. Battle against your friends in a 1 on 1 simulation to see who can generate the most alpha. RAFT will utilize the Yahoo Finance API and and Websockets to communicate and compare performance metrics peer to peer. The game will be barebones in design, featuring a buy and sell button and trader's gut instinct. Do you think you have what it takes to come out on top?

That's it, I have officially created a website. Initially, I couldn't figured out how to get into my website. It said [blank] sent an invalid response. After, consulting discord, I found someone else experiencing the same "Issue was I was typing in https://, it wasn't working, but when I do http:// it does work."

I am driving my own website name! It took a while for my website request to stop pending. The proccess of tying my website name to my ip address was easy. 
I have updated my website to https instead of http so now it is secured. The proccess is neat becuase of how simple it is to make a secured website. I forgot to hit escape when after I was in editing mode in git bash and left and made a merge conflict unintentionally. I restarted the cornel and deleted the change and tried again.
2/6/2023: Now I am updating the HTML structure and my favorite part are the hpyerlinks becuase it seems like majic. It is cool being able to edit a website and seeing it change after you save. Like I did something. The format type of html is confusing. I am figuring things out by trial and error by deleting it and seeing what it does. I like all the boxes and borders but don't really get the intention or integration. I've been busy breaking your code in html and experimenting with boxes. I have so say it's hard to break the code and do stuff to it than I anticipated. It is completely unlike Python or C++ and more like an instruction manual instead of step by step directions.
2/7: I've decided to timestamp the things I do. That way It'll be better indexed. Today I changed my website through the github repo proffessor Jensen made for me. I was struggling until I realized I had to gitclone the url into my projectfile to access eployWebsite.sh, but after that, it was suprisingly smooth sailing.
